    **How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?**
    A hardware hack is a physical microchip or pc/hardware component altered with or added to hardware like a motherboard or pc, hardware hacks are to extract information or enable a software hack like what happened in the chinese hack. This can also cause hardware failure or uploads data through the hardware hack. A software hack is strictly a digital attack mostly possible through the internet and manipulated digital code. This causes things such as viruses or a data breach. https://store.expliot.io/blogs/iot/a-fundamental-guide-to-hardware-hacking
    
    **What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?**
      Hardware implants like done by the Chinese are where you add a small piece of hardware; Or tampering where you replace a piece of hardware or alter a set piece of hardware with a different set of instructions or data that can hack into the hardware to enable spying. https://chat.openai.com/c/4c3e910f-1356-49ca-a51d-17850b104673
   
    **Explain how the hack worked.**
      The Chinese implanted "microchips about the size of a grain of rice" into many servers motherboards. These microchips inserted data into the motherboards and changed data that allowed 3rd party unknown computers to hack into the computers and spy on data. https://web.archive.org/web/20190330085155/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies
   
    **How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?**
      The investigators learned the chips were inserted in the motherboards during the manufacturing process because they were found in the inspection phase before they were shipped to the consumer. The manufacturing process for all 30 companies that had found the chips all were sub contracted and manufactured in China. It became obvious the Chinese had something to do with the chips being inserted.


## Things i want to know more about
  I wonder where the U.S agencies spy.
  Is it really worth going through all this trouble and risk by manufacturing in China just to save money?
  This was only what was discovered imagine what we haven't found. It only gets more difficult to detect hacks like this using cutting edge technology.
