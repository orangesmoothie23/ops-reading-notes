    ## Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
        Higher speed is the ultimate goal of a cpu so i would say higher speed. So a computer could have less cores and faster if it has more gigahertz than a cpu with more cores than it. Although more cores will help you increase the speed of the processor. They're both important it's more about what you would want in your setup. The cores a computer needs is typically based on what you want to use the computer for. If its for gaming a good comfortable amount to have would be six cores. For an office computer four cores should be fine. Most of this information can be found on section 4, "Get a motherboard which fits your processor." https://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Computer
    
    ## What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
        You want to find a motherboard that has a the same/compatible socket as you cpu. I've used pc partpicker in the past or simply google searching should tell you what is compatible and what not.
      
      ## What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
          For the most part its not even a debate, its standard to just go with an SSD in today's age because of how much faster they are than a regular hard drive. Between SSDs i would only consider the storage space, size of the actual drive, and the speed of them. Maybe i would chose one with a little less storage if it was the only one that would fit my computer. Or maybe i would want one faster but had a little less storage or vice versa.

    ## Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
        I would tell them computers have input devices that send data to a processor that processes data but has to be cooled because of the amount of data it processes. Then it displays the information back to you on a monitor screen from a GPU. I would also tell them that computers have hard drives/SSDs that store data long term. All possible by being connected to a motherboard that allows all of the components to communicate with each other.

## Things I want to know more about
    I would like to know if a fan or water cooler is better on a cpu
    Would ram above 32 gigs actually make any sort of difference?
    Does dust buildup hinder performance?
