This assignment relates to the class because we just did a lab about CMOS and BIOS. We played around in the BIOS and removed and reinstalled the CMOS.

  ##What is the BIOS?
        
        The BIOS is the basic input output system. It is a firmware embedded in a chip in the motherboard called ROM. It's the first thing the computer loads when turned on. It's main purpose is to load the operating system. https://www.learncomputerscienceonline.com/bios/
    
   ##Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?

       The booting process of a computer correlates to how a car starts. You could compare that the starter of the car is the bios which starts the engine (operating system) now the car can run because the engine charges the alternator, which continues to give the engine electricty to run. Same with a computer, except it really just needs a set of instructions like an operating system which is started and activated by the BIOS. 
    
   ##What is the “Power On Self Test”?

      The Power On Self Test is where the bios tests all of the basic hardware in the computer to make sure it's working correctly like the CPU, RAM, graphics card, etc.  For example if something isn't powered on correctly or the RAM isn't seated correctly then the BIOS won't load, you'll just get a black screen which has happened to me many times with my personal computer. https://www.learncomputerscienceonline.com/bios/
      
  ##What is the CMOS?

      The CMOS. Stands for “Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor.” The CMOS stores essential data used by the BIOS and operating system during start up of the computer. https://www.learncomputerscienceonline.com/bios/
    
  ##What is the CMOS battery?

      The CMOS battery is what holds power to the CMOS so when the computer is shut off the CMOS data isnt erased. 

  ## Things I want to know more about

    Why is the operating system loaded into RAM instead of say the regular hard drive or SSD?
