   ##What is Ubuntu?  
      
      It is a free, open source, Linux operating system.
    
  ##Why would you choose to install the LTS version over regular Ubuntu releases?
     
     The LTS version is a long term version of Ubuntu, everything stays the same as long as possible, thus is updated less frequently if at all so not very much changes. The only thing they'll update are bug/software fixes. This is a much more simple version of Ubuntu and easier for newer users. https://web.archive.org/web/20211023143345/https://www.lifewire.com/keep-ubuntu-up-to-date-2202064

  ##How do I install software from the command line?

    You need to first open a terminal, which is done through various methods. You could do this through the graphical interface or through a non graphical terminal. Then You type "sudo apt update." This should update the software of ubuntu after you type your password. https://web.archive.org/web/20211109191517/https://www.lifewire.com/ways-to-open-a-terminal-console-window-using-ubuntu-4075024

   ##Things i want to know more about.

      How does Linux control who does what with updates if it's open source? Are there dedicated Linux devolopers or are they all open source 3rd party devolopers?
