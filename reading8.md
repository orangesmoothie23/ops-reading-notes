    How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)?
      You'll need to burn the iso file to the disk, this is possible simply through windows 7, 8, 10, and 11 as defualt. If you double click the file and no wizard to burn it comes up you must change the file to a isoburn.exe, The same logic is applied to thumb drives.

      You need to open the ISO file as a disk emulator and then choose a drive letter the ISO represents. Even though the drive letter is a virtual drive, windows sees it as a physical drive.
